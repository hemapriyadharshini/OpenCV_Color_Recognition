# OpenCV_Color_Recognition
**Project Goal** is to identify RGB colors &amp; color names in an image

**How To:**
1) Download and save attached 3 files to your local desktop
2) **Input:** 
 Open Cmd Prompt, navigate to the downloaded file location and enter 'python color_detection.py -i Flower.jpg'

**Observation:**
- Using OpenCV for color recognition gave faster output results. 
- Overall project is easy to understand, develop and make custom updates such as mouse hover and adjust rectangle size

**Notes:**
Programming library for machine learning and computer vision; Used mainly for projects that recognize patterns such as face/objects/colors, track and classify object movements (Humans/animals/cars), join images together to produce high resolution image of an entire scene, etc.,

Used for real time machine learning and deep learning applications. Originally written in C++, faster than Keras;  

**Real time applications:** 
Self driving vehicles: Detect lanes, find path for autonomous vehicles; detect traffic lights, speed limit, traffic signs, etc.,
Photo editing apps;
Event detection: Automatic number plate recognition to control automatic gates, counting people, automated attendance system;
Industrial automation: Categorize objects; product label identification;
Medical image processing;
Military applications: Detect enemy movements;
Agriculture equipments;
Popular real world example: Amazon Go
